## 📌 Overview
The Smart Attendance System is an AI-powered face recognition solution designed to automate and streamline attendance marking in real-time. Leveraging the power of deep learning models like MTCNN for face detection and InceptionResnetV1 for face recognition, the system achieves over 99% accuracy with sub-200ms latency. Integrated with IP cameras, it ensures seamless tracking without manual intervention. The platform features a dynamic React.js dashboard, backed by Node.js and Supabase, providing administrators with insightful analytics, attendance logs, and real-time data visualization. This project blends machine learning, computer vision, and full-stack web development to solve a real-world problem efficiently and intelligently.
